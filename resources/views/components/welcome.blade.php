            Welcome, I am Andrew Shields a Software Engineer / Web Developer always on the quest to learn new things.
            I have been building & fixing various electronics and computers for 15+ years and I still love working on
            projects and solutions.
            I have the pleasure of being a Lambda School alumni, prior to professional software development my
            background is in the
            lucrative automotive industry. This is my personal piece of the World Wide Web, I created it as a place to
            share my
            projects and thoughts. This entire application and most projects are self hosted running off of a first gen
            Raspberry Pi, and I challenged myself to learn a new piece of technology every step of the way stepping
            completely out of my comfort zone by developing this application with PHP and Laravel, a language and
            framework
            I had zero prior exposure to. It may not be as flashy or smooth as my usual single-page applications but I
            think this application really highlights my ability to stay flexible with new technologies and adapt to
            achieve the desired goal!
