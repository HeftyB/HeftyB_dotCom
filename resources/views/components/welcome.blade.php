            Welcome, I am Andrew Shields a Software Engineer / Web Developer always on the quest to learn new things.
            I have been building & fixing various electronics and computers for 15+ years and I still love working on
            projects and solutions.
            I have the pleasure of being a Bloom Institute of Technology alumni (formally Lambda School), prior to professional software development my
            background was in the
            lucrative automotive industry. This is my personal piece of the World Wide Web, I created it as a place to
            share my
            projects and thoughts. This entire application and most projects are self hosted running off of a first gen
            Raspberry Pi, and I challenged myself to learn a new piece of technology every step of the way stepping
            completely out of my comfort zone by developing this application with PHP and Laravel, a language and
            framework
            I had zero prior exposure to. It may not be as flashy or smooth as my usual single-page applications but I
            think this application really highlights my ability to stay flexible with new technologies and adapt to
            achieve the desired goal!
